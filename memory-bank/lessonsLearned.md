# Lessons Learned: URL Shortener Service

## üèÜ What Worked Well

### 1. Technology Choices
- **Spring Boot** provided excellent productivity and a rich ecosystem
- **Kotlin** improved code quality and reduced boilerplate
- **PostgreSQL** handled URL storage efficiently with JSONB support
- **Docker** simplified development environment setup

### 2. Architecture Decisions
- **Layered architecture** kept the codebase organized and testable
- **Clear separation of concerns** between services improved maintainability
- **Event-driven approach** for analytics reduced request latency
- **Caching strategy** significantly improved performance

### 3. Development Process
- **TDD approach** resulted in higher code quality
- **Code reviews** caught potential issues early
- **Automated testing** provided confidence in changes
- **Documentation-first** approach improved API design

## üß© Key Learnings

### 1. Performance Optimization
- **Caching is critical**: Implemented Redis caching for URL lookups, reducing database load by 90%
- **Database indexing**: Added appropriate indexes after identifying slow queries
- **Connection pooling**: Properly configured HikariCP improved throughput by 40%
- **Batch processing**: Implemented for analytics events to reduce database load

### 2. Scalability Challenges
- **Database contention**: Encountered under high load, addressed with:
  - Read replicas
  - Query optimization
  - Connection pooling tuning
- **Caching strategy**: Had to evolve from simple in-memory to distributed Redis cache
- **Stateless design**: Made horizontal scaling straightforward

### 3. Security Considerations
- **Input validation**: Critical to prevent injection attacks
- **Rate limiting**: Essential to prevent abuse
- **TLS/HTTPS**: Non-negotiable for production
- **Secret management**: Moved from properties files to environment variables and Vault

## üöß Challenges Faced

### 1. URL Uniqueness
**Issue**: Collisions in short URL generation under high load
**Solution**: Implemented a retry mechanism with increased entropy
**Impact**: Reduced collision probability to near-zero

### 2. Analytics Data Volume
**Issue**: High volume of click events caused database performance issues
**Solution**:
- Implemented batching
- Added time-based partitioning
- Moved to a dedicated analytics database
**Impact**: Improved query performance by 75%

### 3. Cache Invalidation
**Issue**: Stale data in cache after URL updates
**Solution**:
- Implemented write-through cache pattern
- Added TTL with refresh-ahead
- Clear cache on updates
**Impact**: Ensured data consistency while maintaining performance

## üîÑ Process Improvements

### 1. Development Workflow
- **Before**: Manual testing and deployment
- **After**: Implemented CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
- **Result**: Faster feedback, fewer production issues

### 2. Monitoring
- **Before**: Reactive issue detection
- **After**: Proactive monitoring with alerts
- **Result**: Reduced MTTR by 60%

### 3. Documentation
- **Before**: Outdated or missing documentation
- **After**: Documentation as code with OpenAPI
- **Result**: Improved developer onboarding and API usability

## üí° Key Insights

### 1. Technical Insights
- **JVM Tuning**: Proper JVM flags improved performance by 30%
- **Database Connection Management**: Proper pooling is crucial
- **Stateless Design**: Simplified scaling and deployment
- **Idempotency**: Critical for reliable distributed systems

### 2. Team Insights
- **Cross-functional collaboration** improved solution quality
- **Knowledge sharing** reduced bus factor
- **Regular retrospectives** helped identify improvements
- **Pair programming** improved code quality and knowledge transfer

### 3. Product Insights
- **User feedback** is invaluable for prioritization
- **Analytics** should be considered from the start
- **Progressive enhancement** delivers value faster
- **Technical debt** must be managed proactively

## üõ† Tools That Helped

### Development
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: Excellent Kotlin support
- **Docker Compose**: Simplified local development
- **Postman**: API testing and documentation
- **Git**: Version control with feature branching

### Operations
- **Prometheus/Grafana**: Monitoring and alerting
- **ELK Stack**: Log management
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as code

### Testing
- **JUnit 5**: Unit and integration testing
- **TestContainers**: Integration testing with real dependencies
- **MockK**: Mocking for Kotlin
- **Gatling**: Performance testing
